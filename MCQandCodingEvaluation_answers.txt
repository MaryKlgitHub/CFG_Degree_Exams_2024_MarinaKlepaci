Q3.1
The aggregate function is written not correct - COUNT(e.course.id) is incorrect;
it should be COUNT(e.course_id) to count enrollments correctly.

The tables students and enrollments are referenced, but not aliased
(s and e are used in the SELECT clause but not defined):

SELECT
	s.student_id, s.student_name, COUNT(e.course.id) AS course_count
FROM students.s

Table aliases are used in the SELECT clause (s.student_id, s.student_name) but are not defined in the FROM clause
(student_id, student_name)

so it should be:
GROUP BY
    s.student_id, s.student_name


Q3.2
1. There's no explicit JOIN condition specified between students and enrollments, so it will be better
to specify how the students and enrollments tables are joined based on the student_id column:

SELECT
    s.student_id, s.student_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS course_count
FROM
    students s
JOIN
    enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id

2. USE DATE or TIMESTAMP functions for date comparisons
3. The dataset is large, so it would be great to optimize indexes like 'students.student_id' to optimize performance.
