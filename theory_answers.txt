Q1.1 A view in SQL acts like a virtual table made by a SELECT statement. 
It shows data from other tables but doesn't store the data itself. This 
sets views apart from tables, which actually store data.
Q1.2 A pull request is a request for review and discussion of changes 
before merging, while a merge is the actual action of integrating those 
changes into the target branch.
Q1.3 The else block runs when no exceptions are raised in the try block. 
I'd use it to print a message confirming a successful operation.
Q1.4 GET, POST, and DELETE are three commonly used API methods. The GET 
method retrieves data from various resources, such as fetching data from a 
database. POST sends data to the server to create or update resources. 
DELETE removes data from a resource.
Q1.5 In a Scrum team, there are three primary roles: Scrum Master, Product 
Owner, and Development Team. The Product Owner represents stakeholders and 
delivers value by prioritizing the backlog and defining features. The 
Scrum Master facilitates the development process by removing obstacles, 
ensuring adherence to Scrum practices, and maintaining team focus. The 
Development Team is cross-functional and self-organizing, responsible for 
delivering increments of the product during each Sprint.
Q1.6 Primary Key and Foreign Key Constraints are two commonly used types 
of database constraints. The Primary Key Constraint ensures each record in 
a table is uniquely identified by a specific column. A Foreign Key 
Constraint establishes a relationship between two tables, ensuring values 
in the child table's foreign key column match values in the parent table's 
primary key column.
Q1.7 In Python, the break statement stops the loop right away and jumps to 
the next code outside the loop. It's like pressing an emergency stop button when you've 
found what you needed.The continue statement skips the rest of the current 
loop's instructions and jumps to the next iteration of the loop. It's handy when you want to skip 
over certain things and move on to the next item in a list or task.
Q1.8 The code would result in a TypeError because in Python, you cannot 
directly concatenate a string ("2") with an integer (2) using the + 
operator. Python expects both operands of the + operator to be of the same 
type for concatenation to work, either both strings or both integers. To 
resolve this error we can convert the integer 2 to a string using str(2).
